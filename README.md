# mini-movie-actor-database

A small movie/actor database developed in C to practice using the hash table data structure

This is a small database system using hash tables and binary files used to simulate how a larger database which stores movie information such as movie titles and actors would work. This project was also useful for brushing up on reading and writing to binary files in C.
